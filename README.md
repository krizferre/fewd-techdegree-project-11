# React Flickr Gallery

Treehouse Front End Web Developmet Techdegree Project 11: 

Create an image gallery using React and the Flickr API. 
Build the gallery components, add to the supplied CSS and set up routing.

## Getting Started

Click `Clone or download` button to get a copy of the project on your local machine.
You can use `git clone`, for example,
```
$ git clone https://github.com/krizferre/fewd-techdegree-project-11.git
```

Or you can choose to download the zip file by clicking the `Download ZIP` button.

### Prerequisites

You need to install `Node.js` in order to run the project.
I prefer to install it via [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
Installing this will also install `npm`.

Then you have to provide your own `config.js` file in the `src` folder with the following format:
```
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
export default apiKey;
```
To get your own APY Key, you may read this [reference](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html) from Flickr.

### Installing

Execute `npm install` in the terminal inside the react-flickr-gallery folder to install the required dependencies.

## Running

Execute `npm start` to run the application inside the react-flickr-gallery folder. This will use 3000 as the default port, and will automatically open the website in your default browser.
